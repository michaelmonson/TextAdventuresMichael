# TextAdventuresMichael

My First Text Adventure Attempt in C# to assist in learning the language.

My goal is to create an "Old Skool" Text Adventure, similar to the popular text adventures by INFOCOM back in the 1980's, 
the hey day of the first personal computers, and the age of text adventures!  Back when games were spooled from the floppy
diskette!  Atari's "dual density" 5¼" disks provided an awesome 130 Kilobytes of storage, and Commodore64 disk drives delivered
an impressive 174 KB!  Of course, that not quite half of the 360 KB that a 5¼" floppy diskette could supply when formatted on an
IBM Personal Computer (origin of the "PC") and later expanded to 1.2 MB for the High Density versions.  The 3½" disks brought the
storage to 1.44 MB, which was nearly a factor of ten times the capacity (and speed!) of the old Atari Floppies.  :-)

Nowadays young people can hardly appreciate the hardware of 35 years ago when we have hard drives not just in GigaBytes,
but in TerraBytes!  

The good news is that with modern programming languages vastly superior to the ubiquitous "BASIC" released in slightly different
flavours on all the old 8-bit Home computers (although many used the famous 6502 CPU, so they were relatively similar languages),
the potential of what one can program these days is far beyond the wildest dreams of programmers in those days. 

Plus, without spaghetti code (e.g. the infamous "GOTO" command, while GOSUB was only marginally better), a computer program
written in BASIC is far easier to maintain!  Even for the programmer that gets in over his or her ears with convoluted code
jumping everywhere throughout the program.  Best left for small applications.

So, I'm excited to see what I can accomplish, especially with the sophistication of the language parser.  Back in the day,
I wrote a number of text adventures myself, for the Commodore and Atari computers.  Even the Apple IIe and one on IBM whilst
learning "TurboBasic"  (my first language that exposed me to the concept of REAL NAMED subroutines! :-)

But on the old machines, with just over 38KB of available RAM (after the BASIC language stole 10 - 15 KB of available memory), 
I had the problem of writing programs that exceeded the available memory.  I didn't learn enough to spool it from disk at that
time, the way INFOCOM's adventures did (e.g. ZORK! , WishBringer , Hitchhiker's Guide, etc.) to maximize space.  I have always
loved detailed descriptions, so I have always tried to weave a rich literary experience into my adventures.  Even with being
limited to just two lines (40 characters each) for a String variable (minus the line number and variable size, it went quickly!

So, taking inspiration from the first text adventure I ever played on the Commodore64, I hope to bring back some 
excitement for this vanished genre of interactive literature... only made possible by a computer!

Enjoy the experience as I learn how to program in the C# language.
